### Peer Review: Bowen Henry
Great job bro, code works well and it's responsive too. I like the colors you chose, simple but all pop out very nicely. Maybe later you could add more of a larger border around the apps or just design the background a little more, make some kind of a theme with your games. Nice images and font too
